# Thesis: Research on Adversarial Robustness of Machine Learning-Based Intrusion Detection Systems


Research, design, and develop intrusion detection systems using Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Ensemble Learning.
Utilize Multimodal Learning in combination with GANs to generate adversarial traffic. Additionally, apply adversarial attack algorithms such as FGSM, ZOO, DeepFool, and C&W to create adversarial traffic.
This adversarial traffic is then tested on the previously developed intrusion detection systems (Transferability).
Train the intrusion detection systems with defense strategies and test different adversarial samples on the trained systems to evaluate the models 'Robustnessâ€™.
